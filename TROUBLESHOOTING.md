# Troubleshooting: Blog Loading Issue

## Current Status
- **Issue**: Blog posts are not loading correctly in the Next.js application
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Problem Description
When accessing the blog section, the application fails to load blog posts. The issue appears to be related to file path resolution when trying to access MDX files in the content directory.

## Debugging Steps Taken

1. **Path Resolution**
   - Updated content directory path in `blog-utils.ts` multiple times
   - Tried both relative and absolute paths
   - Added debug logs to track the current working directory and file resolution

2. **Server Configuration**
   - Verified Next.js configuration
   - Checked for proper file permissions
   - Ensured all required dependencies are installed

3. **Code Changes**
   - Updated import paths
   - Added error handling and logging
   - Verified file existence checks

## Current Configuration
- Content Directory: `/content/blog` (relative to project root)
- Blog Utils: `/client/src/lib/blog-utils.ts`
- Blog Page: `/client/src/app/blog/page.tsx`

## Next Steps
1. Verify the working directory when the application starts
2. Check server logs for any file system errors
3. Test file reading with a simple Node.js script
4. Consider using `process.cwd()` with proper path joining

## Error Logs
(To be filled with actual error messages from the server logs)

## Environment
- Node.js Version: v23.10.0
- Next.js Version: 14.x
- Operating System: macOS
