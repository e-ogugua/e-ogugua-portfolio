# Development Status

## Current Issue: Blog Loading Problem

### Problem Description
The blog section is currently experiencing issues with loading blog posts. The problem appears to be related to file path resolution when accessing MDX files in the content directory.

### Current Configuration
- **Content Directory**: `/content/blog` (relative to project root)
- **Blog Utils**: `/client/src/lib/blog-utils.ts`
- **Blog Page**: `/client/src/app/blog/page.tsx`
- **Test Page**: `/client/src/app/test/page.tsx` (for debugging)

### Debugging Steps Taken

1. **Path Resolution**
   - Updated content directory path in `blog-utils.ts`
   - Verified path resolution with `process.cwd()`
   - Added debug logging

2. **Testing**
   - Created a test script (`test-fs.js`) to verify file system access
   - Created a test page (`/test`) to isolate the blog loading functionality

3. **Findings**
   - File system access works correctly in the test script
   - Path resolution in Next.js app router needs adjustment

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fixes**
   - [ ] Verify the working directory in Next.js app router
   - [ ] Check server logs for file system errors
   - [ ] Test with a simplified blog page

2. **Code Improvements**
   - [ ] Add proper error boundaries
   - [ ] Implement loading states
   - [ ] Add input validation

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test with different environments
   - [ ] Add unit tests for blog utilities
   - [ ] Test with different content structures

### How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit the test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test
   ```

3. Check the browser console and server logs for any errors.
