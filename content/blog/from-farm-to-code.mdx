# From Farming to Coding: Entrepreneurial Lessons

Before I became a full-time developer, I was running **PoshPOULE Farms**. Chickens, organic crops, logistics — you name it. It was messy, unpredictable, and deeply educational.

## Discipline of farming

Farming teaches patience. Crops don't grow overnight. Chickens don't mature in a week. You plan, wait, and trust the process. Coding is the same. You can't rush learning or skip debugging. You show up daily.

## Business parallels

- **Cashflow**: Feed bills don't wait. Same with server costs.  
- **Customers**: A missed delivery loses trust, just like buggy software.  
- **Scaling**: Expanding a farm is like scaling an app — more moving parts, more risk.  

## Hybrid identity

I'm both a farmer and a coder. That dual lens helps me approach problems differently. And honestly, sometimes debugging code feels easier than catching chickens!

## Takeaway

Whatever your background, bring it into tech. Those "unrelated" experiences may be your biggest advantage.
