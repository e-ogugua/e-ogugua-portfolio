# Faith in Business: Why Values Matter

Business without values is dangerous. Short-term profits can blind you to long-term impact.

## Why values matter
- They guide decisions under pressure.  
- They shape how you treat employees and clients.  
- They give meaning beyond money.  

## Faith as foundation
For me, faith is the bedrock. It shapes honesty, stewardship, and service. That's how I want to run CEOTR, PoshPOULE, and my digital ventures.

## Legacy thinking
When values drive business, you build something that lasts beyond you.
I've walked away from profitable opportunities that would have required compromising my valuesâ€”decisions that ultimately led to better opportunities.

## Final Thoughts

Faith in business isn't about preaching to clients or putting religious symbols everywhere. It's about letting timeless principles guide your decisions, treating people with dignity, and building something that outlasts you. In the end, the most successful businesses are those that make the world better, not just richer.
