# Faith-Driven Productivity

Productivity without purpose is emptiness. Faith anchors productivity in meaning.

## How it works
- Start your day with prayer.  
- Work as service, not just hustle.  
- Rest intentionally â€” sabbath matters.  

## Balance matters
Without balance, productivity becomes burnout. With faith, it becomes fulfillment.
