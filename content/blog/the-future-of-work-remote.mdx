# The Future of Work is Remote (and Borderless)

The world is flattening. Work is moving online, across borders.

## What this means
- You can work for anyone, anywhere.  
- Borders don't limit opportunities.  
- Skills matter more than location.  

## Preparing for it
- Build digital-first portfolios.  
- Learn async communication.  
- Embrace cultural awareness.  

## Final thought
Remote work isn't coming — it's already here.
