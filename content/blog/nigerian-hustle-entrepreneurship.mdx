# Entrepreneurship Lessons from Nigerian Hustle

Nigeria is a crash course in entrepreneurship. Power cuts, inflation, unstable policies â€” yet businesses still thrive.

## Lessons I've learned
- **Adaptability**: Pivot fast when conditions change.  
- **Resourcefulness**: Work with limited tools.  
- **Community**: Relationships often matter more than capital.  

## Why it matters
If you can build in Nigeria, you can build anywhere. The hustle here trains resilience and creativity.
