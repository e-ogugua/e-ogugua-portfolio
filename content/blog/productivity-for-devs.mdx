# Productivity for Developers: Systems That Work

Developers love shiny tools, but productivity is more about discipline than apps. Here's what works for me.

## Time blocking

Instead of endless to-do lists, I block time. Two hours for coding, one hour for writing, thirty minutes for review. This reduces decision fatigue.

## Daily reflection

Every evening, I jot down: *What did I achieve? What blocked me? What's next?* Over time, this creates a feedback loop.

## Tools I use

- **VS Code + GitHub Copilot** for coding flow.  
- **Notion** for task tracking.  
- **Google Calendar** for blocks.  

## Lessons from practice

- Protect deep work — no WhatsApp in focus hours.  
- Don't multitask.  
- Rest is productive.  

## Closing

Productivity is not about cramming 20 hours. It's about working with clarity and consistency. As a dev, your best tool is your mind — treat it well.
- 20% of features create 80% of the value
- 20% of bugs cause 80% of the crashes
- 20% of your work produces 80% of your results

Identifying and focusing on that critical 20% has been a game-changer for my productivity.

## Energy Management Over Time Management

### 1. Ultradian Rhythms
I schedule my most demanding work during my peak energy hours (mornings) and save meetings and admin work for the afternoon slump.

### 2. The 90-Minute Focus Cycle
Working in 90-minute sprints with short breaks in between aligns with the body's natural energy cycles, leading to better focus and fewer mistakes.

## Final Thoughts

Productivity isn't about doing more—it's about doing what matters most. By implementing these systems, I've been able to accomplish more in 4-6 focused hours than I used to in 12+ hours of scattered work. The key is consistency and continuous refinement of your personal productivity system.
