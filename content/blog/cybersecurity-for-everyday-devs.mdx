# Cybersecurity for Everyday Developers

You don't need to be a security expert to build safely. As a developer, you already hold power — don't abuse it, and don't neglect it.

## Common pitfalls
- Hardcoding secrets.  
- Ignoring validation.  
- Using outdated libraries.  

## Practical steps
- Use environment variables.  
- Sanitize inputs.  
- Keep dependencies updated.  
- Learn basic OWASP Top 10.  

## Mindset shift
Security is not "extra work." It's part of being a responsible developer.

## Tools Every Developer Should Know

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- SonarQube
- ESLint security plugins
- GitLeaks for detecting secrets in code

### 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite Community Edition

## Incident Response Basics

1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and set up alerts
2. **Containment**: Limit the damage
3. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve

## Final Thoughts

Security isn't about being perfect—it's about making it significantly harder for attackers. By implementing these practices, you'll be ahead of most developers in building secure applications. Remember, the best security is layered and proactive, not reactive.
