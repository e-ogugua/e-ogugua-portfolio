# Faith and Tech: Building with Purpose

People often ask me: *How do you balance coding, business, and faith?* My answer is simple — they are not separate compartments. They feed into each other.

## Faith as compass

My faith sets my values: honesty, stewardship, service. It affects how I handle clients, how I build apps, and how I think about impact. A product is not just lines of code; it's a tool that can change lives.

## Profit vs purpose

Yes, money matters. But without purpose, money feels empty. I want my apps to help people grow — in productivity, in business, in faith. That's why projects like **JEPLIGOM** exist: digital platforms that build spiritual communities.

## Building with eternity in mind

When you code with eternity in mind, you're careful. You think beyond *does it work?* to *does it help?* That's the mindset I try to bring daily.

## Encouragement

You don't need to be religious to build with values. Pick principles that matter to you, and let them shape your work. In the long run, purpose-driven work always outlasts short-term hacks.
