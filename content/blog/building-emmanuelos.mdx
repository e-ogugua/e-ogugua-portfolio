# Building EmmanuelOS: My Personal Digital OS

For years, I've had scattered apps, notes, and systems. EmmanuelOS is my attempt to unify everything.

## What is it?
A personal OS — dashboards, apps, routines, and AI helpers.  

## Why?
- Reduce friction in daily work.  
- Centralize learning + business.  
- Build a lasting digital legacy.  

## Future vision
Think of it like macOS, but for *my life*. That's the journey I'm documenting.
