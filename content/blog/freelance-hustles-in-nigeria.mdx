# Freelance Hustles in Nigeria: Lessons from the Trenches

When I started freelancing in Nigeria, it wasn't glamorous. No fancy laptops or Silicon Valley vibes — just cyber cafés, generator noise, and a deep desire to earn with tech.

## Early mistakes

I underpriced my work. I said *yes* to every client, even when their requests were unrealistic. I delivered projects without contracts. And of course, I got burned — ghosted payments, endless revisions, late nights for pennies.

## Building trust

Things shifted when I started treating freelancing as a business:  
- Writing simple contracts.  
- Asking for upfront deposits.  
- Saying *no* to bad fits.  
- Building a small portfolio site (even a basic one helps).  

## Global vs local clients

Local clients taught me negotiation and resilience. But global freelancing opened my eyes to structure. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr had rules that protected both sides. I began blending both worlds.

## Key takeaways

1. **Value yourself** — cheap work attracts the wrong crowd.  
2. **Set boundaries** — don't let one client eat your whole week.  
3. **Keep learning** — your skills are your currency.  

Freelancing is not easy in Nigeria. But it's possible — and it can be the stepping stone to bigger things.
