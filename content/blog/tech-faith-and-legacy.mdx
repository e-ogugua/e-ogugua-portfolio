## Building Beyond Code

In the fast-paced world of technology, it's easy to get caught up in the latest frameworks, languages, and trends. But as I reflect on my journey—from building my first website to creating over 1,000 applications—I've realized that true impact extends far beyond technical skills or business success.

## The Intersection of Faith and Technology

### 1. Technology as a Tool for Good
- Creating solutions that solve real problems
- Using tech to empower communities
- Building platforms that spread positive messages

### 2. Ethical Considerations in Tech
- Data privacy and security
- Algorithmic bias and fairness
- The social impact of technology

## Building a Lasting Legacy

### 1. Beyond the Bottom Line
- Measuring success by impact, not just income
- Creating opportunities for others
- Leaving the tech industry better than we found it

### 2. The JEPLIGOM Ministry Example
- How a simple app transformed into a community
- The power of technology to connect and uplift
- Lessons in servant leadership

## Practical Steps for Purpose-Driven Tech Work

### 1. Daily Integration
- Starting the day with intention
- Finding meaning in mundane tasks
- Seeing work as worship

### 2. Long-Term Vision
- Building systems that outlast you
- Documenting knowledge for others
- Mentoring the next generation

## Final Thoughts

As we build the digital future, let's remember that the most important code we'll ever write is the legacy we leave in people's lives. Technology may be our craft, but our true impact is measured in the lives we touch and the positive change we create in the world.
