# Intro to Web Development

## What is web development?
It's the craft of building websites and apps that run in browsers. From simple static pages to complex apps like Facebook, it all falls under web dev.

## Core building blocks
- **HTML**: structure  
- **CSS**: style  
- **JavaScript**: interactivity  

## How the web works
A browser requests a page from a server. The server responds with HTML, CSS, and JS. The browser renders it for the user. That's the cycle.

## HTML boilerplate
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Adding style
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## Interactivity
```javascript
document.querySelector("h1").onclick = () => alert("Clicked!");
```

You've just built your first interactive page.
